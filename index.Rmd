ISI-BUDS is a six-week summer program introducing undergraduate students to modern methodology and practice of biostatistics and data science. The program will highlight applications in cutting
edge biomedical research, will train students in fundamentals of biostatistics, data science, and computing, and will culminate in a team project co-supervised by statisticians and biomedical scientists.

**Support**: there are no costs or fees associated with the program. Moreover, accepted participants will be provided with

- up to $500 to cover travel expenses
- free housing that includes a meal plan 
- $1,000 stipend for incidental expenses
